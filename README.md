## Logistics & Availability

### ⏰ Working Hours

1. **9-5 Strict** - I maintain traditional business hours and am generally unavailable outside 9am-5pm.
   - _In practice:_ I like knowing what's waiting for me as part of my day, but I will always make time when needed
2. **Night Owl** - I do my best work later in the day and may send messages in the evening.
   - _In practice:_ I'm very productive in the later hours, especially when the noise levels die down
3. **other**

_Additional notes:_ I make it a priority to be available when I'm needed. If something is important I want to know and I want to help as much as possible.

### 💬 Communication Preferences

1. **Slack** - Slack is my go-to for quick questions and team discussions.
   - _In practice:_ Keep me informed, ask for help or just chat
2. **Video Calls** - I prefer face-to-face video calls for complex conversations.
   - _In practice:_ Deep planning, deep thoughts and when something needs to be shown
3. **WhatsApp** - For urgent matters, you can reach me on WhatsApp.
   - _In practice:_ When something is critical during the after hours
4. **other**

_Additional notes:_ Just talking to me in person is always an option

### 📅 Calendar Philosophy

1. **Open Book** - My calendar is public - feel free to book any open slot.
2. **other**

_Additional notes:_ My calendar is open and visible, if you need my time feel free to reach out in person if I'm free or just book time with me. If you schedule - please try your best to provide context ahead of time so I know if it's possible to help even before the meeting or remove the need for it altogether

## Feedback & Growth

### 🎯 Feedback Style

1. **Radical Candor** - I believe in direct, honest feedback delivered with care.
   - _In practice:_ I will do my best to collect and provide relevant feedback about areas you can improve in
2. **Written First** - I like to share feedback in writing first so you can process.
   - _In practice:_ When I see small things that bother me I will do my best to share directly in written format so you can continue to reflect
3. **other**

_Additional notes:_ Sometimes I will provide quick feedback for something that just happend, that's a way to keep the feedback fresh and "hit the iron while it is hot"

### 🤝 1:1 Philosophy

1. **Your Agenda** - Our 1:1s are your time - you drive the agenda.
   - _In practice:_ 1:1s are your time - bring over the topics that you want to discuss and tackle
2. **Tactical Unblocking** - I focus on removing blockers and helping you move faster.
   - _In practice:_ We will use the time to review project status, see where you need help and provide guidance
3. **other**

_Additional notes:_ I will use 1:1s to get to know you, bond with you, better understand you and help with whichever topic I can - whether your personal growth, your people's growth or the tasks and challenges that you need help with (and I will also be a place to vent and be heard)

## Values, Quirks & Pet Peeves

### ⭐ My Top Values

1. **Ownership** - I value people who take full responsibility for their work.
   - _In practice:_ I want you and your team to be the most knowledgeable in your area of ownership, I encourage you to come up with ideas and improvements. I will give you the space to drive that area forward, while helping with my own experience and guidance
2. **Curiosity** - I appreciate those who ask questions and seek to understand deeply.
   - _In practice:_ I like informed answers and willingness to learn and dive deep. I want you to be a source of knowledge and also to impart that knowledge to me, other leads and the rest of the org
3. **Speed** - I believe in moving fast, iterating, and learning quickly.
4. **Quality** - I prioritize craftsmanship over getting things fast.
5. **Kindness** - I believe we can be both high-performing and compassionate.
   - _In practice:_ Staying kind, helpful and cooperative is the always the first priority. Even the most brilliant piece of code or architecture is worth nothing if you've burned all bridges and good will
6. **teamwork**
   - _In practice:_ The team is there to help you, and you are there to help them, grow together and win together
7. **other**

_Additional notes:_ Speed and quality are a delicate balancing act, you need to feel comfortable switching between them at the appropriate times. It is not always easy to understand when to go with one over the other. When in doubt - let's talk and decide together

### 🐛 Known Bugs (Things I'm Working On)

1. **Forgets to Celebrate** - I focus on the next thing and forget to celebrate wins.
2. **other**

_Additional notes:_ I tend to throw ideas and tasks that are not the most important thing at the moment, I will sometimes talk to you to get an estimate and understand if it's possible to fit it in, but it is by no means a commitment to execute. If the timeline is too tight or the team doesn't have any capacity - push back and let me know, we will differ until the time is right

### 😤 Pet Peeves

1. **Surprises** - I prefer to hear about problems early, not last-minute.
   - _In practice:_ You don't (and mostly shouldn't) come to me as soon as something goes wrong, but if you're lost or way off schedule then I should know about it so I can help
2. **Ego over Team** - I value team success over individual glory.
3. **Solutions without Problems** - Please share the problem first before jumping to solutions.
4. **Lateness** - I value punctuality as a sign of respect.
   - _In practice:_ I understand that unexpected things happen, but if you know you're going to be late or that something unexpected happend - please let me know ahead of time
5. **other**

_Additional notes:_ If you schedule a meeting, please add an agenda, it will help both you and anyone else who joins.
When you write documents please try to proofread them and fix any typos or grammar mistakes (AI is 100% a valid tool for this).
Documentation is worth investing time into - it helps you better understand and become an SME in the area, it means less reliance on you when you want to focus on other things and it means you can be OOO without someone getting stuck

## How We Build Together

### 🗺️ Feature Planning Approach

1. **Feature Lead** - You own features end-to-end, from design through release.
2. **Collaborative** - We spec features together, then divide the work.
3. **other**

_Additional notes:_ Include me in design meetings, checklists and estimates. Keep me in the loop so I can be aware and contribute

### 🚀 Starting New Initiatives

1. **Just Start** - Bias toward action - start building and ask forgiveness later.
   - _In practice:_ No need to ask for my permission for small initiatives. If something has a lot of potential but your fear it is very large, let me know and we'll find the time

### ✅ Definition of Done

1. **Released + Metrics** - Done means released AND we've analyzed the metrics.
   - _In practice:_ I trust the PM to analyze usage and metrics and engagement, and I trust you and the team to analyze system stability and performance impact
